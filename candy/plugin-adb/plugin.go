// Package adb is the charly plugin serving the `adb`
// Android-Debug-Bridge check verb AND the `deploy:android` SUBSTRATE (F1) — i.e.
// ALL Android device interaction: the `adb:` verb, the `target: android` app-install
// deploy, and the goadb-backed `charly status` device probe (an importable root package +
// its own go.mod). It exists to keep github.com/zach-klippenstein/goadb OUT of
// charly's core go.mod: the host go-builds this binary and serves it OUT-OF-PROCESS
// over go-plugin gRPC via the charly plugin SDK, so the `adb:` verb dispatches through
// the provider registry exactly like a built-in (the authored `adb: <method>` sugar
// desugars to plugin/plugin_input; the method + per-verb fields ride the input map,
// validated against this plugin's own #AdbInput) AND the `target: android` deploy
// resolves to this plugin's deploy:android provider over the E3b reverse channel. One
// plugin owns the FULL adb/goadb dependency + the single apk install path (R3 — no
// duplicate installer across verb and deploy).
//
// Dual-placement by construction: the SAME NewProvider()/NewMeta() compile INTO charly
// in-process when listed in compiled_plugins, or cmd/serve serves them OUT-OF-PROCESS
// over go-plugin gRPC when they are not — placement is invisible above the registry.
